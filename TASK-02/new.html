    <p>Vikram Batra was an Indian Army officer who achieved martyrdom during the Kargil War in 1999 between India and Pakistan.
        <br>
         Born on September 9, 1974, in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, Batra was commissioned into the Indian Army as a lieutenant.
         <br>
         He played a crucial role in the recapture of Point 5140, a strategic peak in the Kargil region, and earned the nickname "Sher Shah" (Lion King) for his bravery.
        <br>
        One of his most famous quotes, "Yeh Dil Maange More!" ("This heart wants more!"), became iconic and is remembered as a symbol of his indomitable spirit. Tragically, Vikram Batra lost his life in the battle for Point 4875 during Operation Vijay. He was posthumously awarded the Param Vir Chakra, India's highest military decoration for valor, for his exemplary courage and leadership on the battlefield. Vikram Batra's life and sacrifice continue to inspire generations of Indians, 
        and he is remembered as a true hero of the nation.
